# ExtraCreditsSpring2019GameJam

This repository is result Extra Credits Game Jam #3.
This was completed solo and was unable to submit on time missing the deadline by **5 minutes**. It was personally chosen not to submit to the jam, due to game crashing errors.


The unfinished is the version done by the deadline.  The other copy is the update as how the game has progressed.  The game heavily emphasizes on precalculated **linear interpolation** and **bezier curve** calculations for core mechanics of the player and its patterned movement in its world.

>>Here is the link to the [game page](https://kale-eos.itch.io/the-bezier-effect).
Further work will be returned to at a later (currently unknown) time to fully flesh out the game in it's entirety.

This was started on Unity 2018.3.11 and continued on Unity 2019.1.2.  Audio was developed through FL Studio 10.
